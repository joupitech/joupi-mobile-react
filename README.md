# Joupi - Fitness Activity Gamification

Mobile application for gamification of physical activities, encouraging users to have a healthier lifestyle through friendly competition.

Joupi allows users to record various physical activities (from walking to specific training like jiu-jitsu). The app calculates points based on these activities, allowing users to compete in rankings (weekly, etc.) with their friends.
